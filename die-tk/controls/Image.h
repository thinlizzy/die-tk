 * This control simulates a displayable image buffer which also allows to draw into its canvas.
 * It is still on alpha stage so there are some TODOs:
 * - a better constructor to specify an image upon creation
 * - create empty image if no image is specified
 * - resizing control also needs to resize the image or to increase the canvas size
 * - add alignment and stretch in both dimensions
 * - research support for transparent image (not sure if that works with a drawable canvas. X11 is a challenge too)
